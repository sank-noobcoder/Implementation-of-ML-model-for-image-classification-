# 🚀 Image Classification with Machine Learning 🌟

Welcome to the **Image Classification with Machine Learning** project! This web application leverages cutting-edge pre-trained models, **MobileNetV2** and **VGG16**, to classify images into distinct categories, specifically **male** and **female** images. The goal is to provide an intuitive and user-friendly interface for anyone who wants to experience machine learning in action!

## 🌟 Key Features

- **🔍 Choose Your Model**: Select between two powerful pre-trained models, **MobileNetV2** (lightweight and efficient) and **VGG16** (high-accuracy but computationally intense), to classify your images.
- **🖼️ Easy Image Upload**: Drag and drop or browse to upload images effortlessly from your device.
- **⚡ Instant Results**: Receive real-time classification results with the accuracy percentage of your uploaded image.
- **📊 Result Analysis**: View a detailed analysis, with the uploaded image and classification results displayed side by side.
- **📱 Responsive Design**: Fully responsive and optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.
